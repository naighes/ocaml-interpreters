# OCaml interpreters

This is just my experimenting with tokenization, parsing and, especially, interpreters.  
The very first attempts were made with an interpreter for [arithmetic expressions](arithmetic-expression-interpreter/README.ipynb) and one for [lambda calculus](lambda-calculus-interpreter/README.ipynb).  
There's an ongoing attempt to formalize a very simple [functional language](functional-language/README.ipynb) with support for recursion and - obviously - high order functions.
